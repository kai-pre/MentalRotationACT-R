# Cognitive Model for a Mental Rotation Task

![Demo of MR model in action](mr-demo2.gif)

The cognitive model solved a simulated version of the mental rotation task, based on cognitive processes theorised by Shepard and Metzler (1971), Cooper and Shepard (1973), Just and Carpenter (1976), and Yuille and Steiger (1982). It followed the basic processing stages (visual encoding, transformation and comparison, and motor response) described by Cooper and Shepard (1973) and Just and Carpenter (1976). Two separate solving tracks were assumed by the model, akin to the wholesale and piecemeal solving strategies originally suggested by Yuille and Steiger (1982). An instant-based learning mechanism included in ACT-R (Gonzalez et al., 2003) was used to choose the appropriate strategy based on familiarity with the presented stimulus.
